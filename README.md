# React Hooks!

#### Why I'll Never Write A Class Again (almost)

The awesomeness has arrived, otherwise known as [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). In this short demo, I'll give an introduction to React hooks, what they're useful for, and why I'll (almost) never need to use a class for React components again.
